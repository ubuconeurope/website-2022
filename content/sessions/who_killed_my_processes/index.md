All of sudden, one of your processes that should be alive was 'kill'ed by someone's Signal! Who did that? Let's trace the issue with Linux Kernel hacking.In this session, I will talk about a real-life issue I met while working and attendees would learn about where to start if they want to trace signals through Kernel.Attendees at least should know what the Signal is in Computer Science.
