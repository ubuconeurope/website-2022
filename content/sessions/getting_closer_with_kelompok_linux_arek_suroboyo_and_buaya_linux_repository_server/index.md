Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo is a community of Linux users based in Surabaya. This community was formed in 1995 by a group of information technology activists in Surabaya. Because of concern for open source software products in Surabaya. In its development, many ups and downs occurred in the community camp as well as on the way to introducing the city of Surabaya to information and communication technology in the field of open-source software. Many conferences have been passed by Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo. As organizers, committees, partner communities, and as participants. Among them is the openSUSE Asia Summit2019 as a community partner, committee, as well as a speaker. In addition, the LibreOfficeConference was held in Taipei in 2019. Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo is an OSS community that already has a network and reach in Indonesia and the world. In Ubuntu Conference Asia 2021,the Community will be present as Community Partners and will share their experiences of ups and downs in managing this large community and the achievements that have been achieved.KLAS's Buaya repository server was founded in 2007. At that time Buaya was still serving Ubuntu only and was supported by Radnet Digital Indonesia. Since then, this server has continued to grow. From the beginning which could only serve Ubuntu, there are 5 Linux distributions that we can accommodate now. The journey to where it is today has not been easy over the last 14 years. The server had been dead for 2 years, from 2016 to 2018, which in the end we got sponsors to revive it so that it can continue to help spread packages that are more affordable to Linux users throughout Indonesia. Our goal of introducing Buaya is to introduce Buaya to Linux users, especially Ubuntu users in Asia and Indonesia, that we have a free repository server that can be used by anyone and anywhere.
