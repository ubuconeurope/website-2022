I needed LAMP Stack for working with Wordpress.I'm not a developer or software engineer. and I just had only one small laptop.I couldn't use public cloud for security.So, I fell in love with WSL2.At first, I was a little hard to set. but, It was not so hard to drive.Let me show you, how I started setting ubuntu with WSL2 For beginers.
