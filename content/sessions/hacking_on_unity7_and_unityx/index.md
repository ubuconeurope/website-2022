In this session, I’ll be demonstrating how to set up a build environment for Unity7. I’ll then be compiling It live. I’ll also be showing how to set up a build environment for UnityX. I’ll then fix some bugs in it and compile it live. I’ll also demonstrate how to do a Merge Request on GitLab and package it using qckdeb.

### About the speaker
I'm an official Ubuntu Member and the creator and project lead of Ubuntu Unity and Ubuntu Web Remix.
