This session delivers how you can develop your own integration-test environment build tool with the WSL SDK project. WSL SDK project is an open-source project that provides versatile and robust WSL management APIs without any restrictions.Also, I will share how I overcame technical hurdles with this project. If you are interested in the Win32 native programming aspect, you may obtain some insights from my talk.
