Hi everyone! The first UbuCon Asia coming in less then a month!

On this first UbuCon Asia, We'll also have an additional virtual space: Gather Town space
We'll use both Eventyay and Gather Town. 

- Eventyay for ticketing, timetable, video conference calls and Sponsor/Partner Community information page(Exhibition page)
- Gather Town space for Virtual booth(for sponsors and partner communities) and Networking between attendees! 

Since we made decision on this very recently, Other then Virtual booth details, We don't have plans on other details yet.
But, The event is just around the corner! So we're working with content team to bring ideas on Gather space map design quickly.
We'll give you more updates if we have some progress on building gather space.

## Current virtual booth prototype, Integration with eventyay.
Since we'll use both Eventyay and Gather, two platforms will be integrated so that attendees can switch easily whenever they want.
- On Eventyay, We'll put button that takes you to Gather space.
- On Gather space, We'll place an special area(or object) that takes you to Eventyay Video Call.
