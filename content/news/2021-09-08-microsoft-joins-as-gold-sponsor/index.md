We are proud to announce Microsoft as a Gold Sponsor for Ubucon Asia 2021.

Microsoft requires no introduction in the technology world. 

Azure cloud, hybrid cloud and on-premise technologies are leaders in software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

Did you know that Ubuntu-based workloads are among the fastest growing on Microsoft Azure? Their partnership with Canonical has delivered an Azure-optimized kernel, improved performance, advanced security, automatic patching and updates, and flexible pricing options for Ubuntu on Azure as well as open source communities.

We thank Microsoft for their commitment to open source and it's communities in the Asia region.
