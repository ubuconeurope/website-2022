We are gladly to announce Ubuntu as our part of **Diamond Sponsor**.

The Ubuntu desktop as we know is the world's most widely used Linux workstation platform, powering the work of engineers across the globe. Ubuntu today has many flavours and dozens of specialized derivatives. All share common infrastructure and software, making Ubuntu a unique single platform that scales from consumer electronics to the desktop and up into the cloud for enterprise computing. 

As the publisher of Ubuntu, the OS for most public cloud workloads to advanced robots, Canonical provides enterprise security, support, and services for commercial users of Ubuntu. Canonical is responsible for delivering six-monthly milestone releases and regular LTS releases for enterprise production use including the entire online infrastructure for community interaction. Enterprises count on Canonical to support, secure and manage Ubuntu infrastructure and devices.
