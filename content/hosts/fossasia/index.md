FOSSASIA develops Open Source software and hardware solutions with a global developer community from its base in Asia and organizes Open Technology events around the year. The organization also runs coding programs and development contests.

The annual FOSSASIA Summit is the premier Open Technology event in Asia for developers, start-ups, and contributors. It is a unique opportunity to share knowledge and experience about Open Source and meet interesting contributors. 

FOSSASIA was founded in 2009 by Mario Behling and Hong Phuc Dang.
