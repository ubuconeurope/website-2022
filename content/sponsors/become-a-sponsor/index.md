Thank you for your interest in Ubuntu and Ubucon Asia.  
As a non-profit and community organized event, Even Ubucon Asia 2021 is fully virtual event,
We still need support from sponsors to make the event happen.

By becoming one of our sponsors, you are directly contributing to research and development of Ubuntu and Open Source Software, and also making Open Source Community more active and sustainable.

Your contribution makes it possible for us to bring a large number of Ubuntu users and contributors across Asia to connect, interact, help and learn together. It will also grow not just the global Ubuntu communities but also Ubuntu local communities around Asia.

To learn more about our sponsorship program, please refer to our sponsorship brochure.
To become one of our sponsors, contact sponsorship team. sponsorship@ubucon.asia
