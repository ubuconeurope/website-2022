Arek Suroboyo Linux Group (Surabaya Linux User Group) (KLAS) is one of the Linux user groups in the city of Surabaya. We have been around since 1995, and are still active today. We have several routine agendas and facilities that we do and until now we have facilitated them to support Go FOSS activities in Surabaya, such as:

1. Cangkrukan KLAS
2. Local Conferences (Open Infrastucture Day 2019)
3. International Conferences (OpenSUSE.Asia Summit 2019, GNOME.Asia Summit 2019, LibreOffice Conference 2019)
